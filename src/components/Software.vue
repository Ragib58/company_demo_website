    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
      Software development refers to a set of activities dedicated to the
      process of conceiving, specifying, designing, programming, documenting,
      testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications,
      frameworks, or other software components. Software itself is the set of
      instructions or programs that tells a computer what to do. It is
      independent of hardware and makes computers programmable. Software
      development services are aimed at designing, engineering, supporting, and
      evolving various software types. We at Orangebd provide top-quality
      services to our customer and support them to the best of our abilities.
