      News portal is a platform where the mass people can access the latest
      updates or national news. Nowadays, people donâ€™t have the time to read
      newspapers at home and so the mass people depend on online news portals to
      get updated news or magazines and they prefer it to be in one place
      altogether.

        Online newspapers help the reader interact with the paper for detailed
        information that includes the attachment of images, videos or external
        links. Online newspapers are accessible at time and anywhere through
        smartphones unlike the traditional messy tactile newspapers.
